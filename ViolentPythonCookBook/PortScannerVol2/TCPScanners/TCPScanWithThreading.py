This file is part of examples shown in a book
"Violent Python Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers"
Most of the code is copied as is, or with minor changes to make naming easier to understand and some
comments may have been added where i explain to myself how everything works ( the code is not just blindly copied ).
The purpose of these files is for me to understand how the code works and become better at the security field.

# this program scans TCP ports and checks if they react
# we are looking for listening TCP ports

# This is a Connect-scan
# it basically does the 3 way handshake until the end
# which means it's quite easy to get caught if it is used

# SYN, ACK etc scans require python NMAP to be installed
#  http://xael.org/norman/ python/python-nmap

# each port lookup has been threaded for faster scanning speed
